The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare systems worldwide, necessitating accurate predictions of mortality rates to inform public health strategies. This study employs machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast COVID-19 death rates across various regions. We collected a comprehensive dataset that includes demographic information, healthcare resources, and historical COVID-19 metrics. Several ML models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks, were trained and tested to assess their predictive performance.
Results indicated that ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, achieved the highest accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional models. Key findings revealed that factors such as age distribution, comorbidities, and healthcare access are critical predictors of mortality. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance epidemic preparedness and guide effective public health interventions. Future research will aim to refine these models for real-time predictions and further explore the integration of additional data sources.
This is how we can utilize machine learning in Python to predict Covid-19 deaths. By analyzing historical data on confirmed cases and fatalities, we can forecast future mortality rates. You can apply this same methodology to predict Covid-19 deaths and potential waves using the most recent datasets.
